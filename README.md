### Hi, I'm Ricardo GonzÃ¡lez ðŸ‘‹
![](https://5vertice.com/gitcounter/gitcounter.php?User=rickygzz)

I am a Mechanical and Electrical engineer, who has been programming since the age of 11.

I started with QBasic back in 1996, and I felt amazing. I quickly moved to Visual Basic, then to C/C++, Assembler and WinAPI. As of right now, I mainly program in C#, MySQL and I am pushing my way through PHP and web services.
